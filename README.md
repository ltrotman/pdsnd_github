### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data
Submitted by Liz Trotman

### Description
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.
This simple program lets users explore some basic summary information regarding the bikeshare data for three major cities.

***To start the project run python3 bikeshare.py.

### Files used
bikeshare.py, chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, washington.csv

The Data has provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities and looks at data for a six month period during 2017.
